Emotional regulation refers to the ability to manage and modulate emotions in a healthy and adaptive manner. This chapter will explore various techniques for emotional regulation, including:

* **Mindfulness**: Mindfulness involves bringing non-judgmental awareness to the present moment. This practice can help you observe your emotions without getting overwhelmed by them. Explore mindfulness meditation or incorporate mindful activities into your daily routines.

* **Cognitive Reframing**: Cognitive reframing involves changing your perspective on a situation to shift your emotional response. Challenge negative thoughts and reframe them with more positive or realistic alternatives. This technique can help you manage stress, anxiety, and anger.
